PipelineDeals dotfiles
======================

These are dotfiles that are generic enough to use on servers and
delightful enough for developers to get comfy.

For the vim setup to work, you first need to install [Vundle] by running

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

Then once you start vim, install all the plugins by running `:BundleInstall`.
